*Project Euler*
================================

Here is where I put all of the code that I use to solve Project Euler problems. All problems are compiled with the -O flag.

Programming languages Used
================================

Haskell

Haskell Packages Used
================================

Data.MemoCombinators  
Data.Numbers.Primes  
Math.Sieve.Phi  
Math.NumberTheory.Powers.Cubes  

Statistics
================================

Statistics are produced in R using the stringr, ggplot2, and reshape packages and can be found in a folder called "Statistics" in the root directory. 
Note: INIT = Intialization time, MUT = Mutator time (time spent running the program), GC = Garbage collecting time, EXIT = Exit time

Problems to be re-visited
================================
Problem 0044  
Problem 0092  
Problem 0074
