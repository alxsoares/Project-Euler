*Project Euler*
================================

Here is where I put all of the code that I use to solve Project Euler problems. For some problems, you are expected to compile the Haskell program for efficiency along with optimization and memory flags. This will be usually mentioned in the first line of the program. 

Programming languages Used
================================

Haskell

Haskell Packages Used
================================

Data.MemoCombinators
Data.Numbers.Primes
